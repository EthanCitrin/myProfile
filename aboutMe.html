        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h4>I'm a second-year software engineer with a passion for technology and a keen interest for problem-solving. Beyond coding, I'm a sports enthusiast, deeply enjoying both basketball and hockey. My love for these sports extends beyond the court and rink, often finding me organizing games with friends and family or participating in local leagues. Professionally, I've honed my skills in network and technology provisioning during my time at Bell, gaining valuable insights into the ever-evolving tech landscape. On top of that, I'm a driven entrepreneur, proudly owning and operating both a men's basketball league and a window cleaning business. These diverse experiences have not only shaped my professional journey but have also enriched my life with a wide range of experiences and connections.</h4>
